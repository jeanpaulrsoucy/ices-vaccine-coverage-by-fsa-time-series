# ICES Vaccine Coverage in Ontario by FSA Time Series

This repository contains the code to create a time series of vaccine coverage in Ontario by FSA, derived from datasets made available on the [ICES COVID-19 Dashboard](https://www.ices.on.ca/DAS/AHRQ/COVID-19-Dashboard#vaccinecoverage).

The final datasets are available in the `data` directory in wide format (`fsa_ts.csv`) and long format (`fsa_ts_long.csv`).

A brief report describes the data: `fsa_ts.Rmd`.
